2. Which of the following statements will potentially execute? And give values for A, B and C that will make the statement execute:
    if A is true OR A is false OR B is true OR C is true THEN color="blue"
    else if A is true OR B is false OR C is false THEN color="red"
    else if A is true OR B is false OR C is true THEN color="green"
    else color="yellow"



    if A is true OR A is false OR B is true OR C is true THEN color="blue"   execute(true)
    else if A is true OR B is false OR C is false THEN color="red"           execute if A is false (false)
    else if A is true OR B is false OR C is true THEN color="green"          not execute (false)
    else color="yellow"
