1. Which of the following statements will potentially execute? And give values for A, B and C that will make the statement execute:
    if A is true AND B is true AND C is true THEN color="blue"
    else if A is true AND B is false AND C is false THEN color="red"
    else if A is true AND A is false THEN color="orange"
    else if A is true AND B is false AND C is true THEN color="green"
    else color="yellow"

   if A is true AND B is true AND C is true THEN color="blue"    execute (true)
   else if A is true AND B is false AND C is false THEN color="red    execute (false)
   else if A is true AND A is false THEN color="orange"            not execute  (mut)  
   else if A is true AND B is false AND C is true THEN color="green"   not execute (false)
