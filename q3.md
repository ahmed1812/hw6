3. Which of the following statements will potentially execute? And give values for A, B and C that will make the statement execute:
    5.1. if (A is true AND B is true) OR (A is false AND B is true) THEN color="blue"
    5.2. if (A is true AND B is false) OR (A is NOT true AND A is false) THEN color="green"
    5.3. if (A is true AND B is false OR A is false) OR (A is either true or false) THEN color="yellow"
    5.4. if (false AND true) OR (false OR true) THEN color="white"





    5.1. if (A is true AND B is true) OR (A is false AND B is true) THEN color="blue"    (true) or (false) = true  ,  execute (true)
    5.2. if (A is true AND B is false) OR (A is NOT true AND A is false) THEN color="green"   (false) or (false) = false , execute (false)
    5.3. if (A is true AND B is false OR A is false) OR (A is either true or false) THEN color="yellow"  (false) or (true) = true , not execute
    5.4. if (false AND true) OR (false OR true) THEN color="white"     (false) or (true) = true   , not execute
